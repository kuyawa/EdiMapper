#EDI MAPPER

Convert EDI documents to XML with this simple tool. 

This is just a prototype and right now only converts 810 and 210 transaction sets. More transactions can be added on demand. Please contact me to request more maps to be added.

If you're looking for a prolific developer in all walks of technology, from databases, web, desktop, mobile and business documents, with the latest programming tools Swift and Kotlin, just let me know.
